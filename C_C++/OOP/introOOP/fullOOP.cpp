/*
1. Encapsulation - introduction:
    - Encap refers to building data with methods that can operate on that data within a class
    - Essentially, it is the idea of hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside that class from directly interacting with it
    - This does not mean that members of other classes cannot interact at all with the attributes of another object
    - Members of other classes can interact with the attributes of another object through its methods
    - Remember, methods are the functions defined within the class
    - Encapsulation - Methods:
        (1)Getting methods:
            + Retrieving information
        (2)Setting methods:
            + Changing information
    - (1)Getting methods:
        - Setting methods also allow the programmer to easily keep track of attributes that depend on one another
            + Method 1 -> Method 2
        - The setting method allows both attributes to be changed as they should, rather than requiring you to individually change them
